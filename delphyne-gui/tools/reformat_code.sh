# This is a simple script to run the clang-format against all of the code
# in the repository.  clang-format will reformat all of the code according
# to the format described in the top-level .clang-format file in this
# repository.  This script must be run from the top-level of the repository
# in order to find all of the files.  It is recommended to run this before
# opening any pull request.
