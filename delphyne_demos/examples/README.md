# Python Examples

These examples are intended to demonstrate how to use Delphyne
from the python layer. Each script permits the --help argument
which provides a more detailed explanation of the example's
functionality and purpose.

The examples only run from within an installed Delphyne
environment. For more information, read the
[Delphyne Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQ9vDp084pMuHjYmtScLB3F1tdr4iP9w7_OTcoSM1zQ).
